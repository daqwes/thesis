Raw data as obtained after preselection (see the paper).

For N={4,5} no preselection is done. 
The first column 
indicates the measurement basis. To resolve
it, leave the 
decimal system and go the the 3-system.
Then each digit 
corresponds to an ion, where the
value of the digit codes 
the rotation as follows:
0=no rotation
1=sigma_x
2=sigma_y

The 
other columns are the probabilities for the different

quantum states: We start with DDDDD, DDDDS, DDDSD, DDDSS, .... SSSSS.
