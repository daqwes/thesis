abstract = {We consider the problem of regression learning for deterministic design and independent random errors. We start by proving a sharp PAC-Bayesian type bound for the exponentially weighted aggregate (EWA) under the expected squared empirical loss. For a broad class of noise distributions the presented bound is valid whenever the temperature parameter β of the EWA is larger than or equal to 4σ2, where σ2 is the noise variance. A remarkable feature of this result is that it is valid even for unbounded regression functions and the choice of the temperature parameter depends exclusively on the noise level. Next, we apply this general bound to the problem of aggregating the elements of a finite-dimensional linear space spanned by a dictionary of functions ϕ1,…,ϕM. We allow M to be much larger than the sample size n but we assume that the true regression function can be well approximated by a sparse linear combination of functions ϕj. Under this sparsity scenario, we propose an EWA with a heavy tailed prior and we show that it satisfies a sparsity oracle inequality with leading constant one. Finally, we propose several Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithms to approximately compute such an EWA when the number M of aggregated functions can be large. We discuss in some detail the convergence of these algorithms and present numerical experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.}

Yet the numerical challenges associated with sampling from complex probability distributions hampers Bayesian tomography in practical settings. In this article, we introduce an improved, self-contained approach for Bayesian quantum state estimation. Leveraging advances in machine learning and statistics, our formulation relies on highly efficient preconditioned Crank–Nicolson sampling and a pseudo-likelihood. We theoretically analyze the computational cost, and provide explicit examples of inference for both actual and simulated datasets, illustrating improved performance with respect to existing approaches.}

The estimator’s sample complexity is comparable to the strongest convergence guarantees available in the literature and—in the case of the uniform POVM—saturates fundamental lower bounds. Numerical simulations support these competitive features.}

abstract = {A tomographic measurement is a ubiquitous tool for estimating the properties of quantum states, and its application is known as quantum state tomography (QST). The process involves manipulating single photons in a sequence of projective measurements, often to construct a density matrix from which other information can be inferred, and is as laborious as it is complex. Here we unravel the steps of a QST and outline how it may be demonstrated in a fast and simple manner with intense (classical) light. We use scalar beams in a time reversal approach to simulate the outcome of a QST and exploit non-separability in classical vector beams as a means to treat the latter as a ``classically entangled'' state for illustrating QSTs directly. We provide a complete do-it-yourself resource for the practical implementation of this approach, complete with tutorial video, which we hope will facilitate the introduction of this core quantum tool into teaching and research laboratories alike. Our work highlights the value of using intense classical light as a means to study quantum systems and in the process provides a tutorial on the fundamentals of QSTs.},
